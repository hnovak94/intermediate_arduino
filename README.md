# Intermediate Arduino

My intermediate arduino assignments

## Photointerrupter

In this assignment we learned how to code a photointerrupter with an LED. In my code the LED would remain off until something "interrupted" the sensor, then the LED would turn on and the counter would go up by one. The serial moniter tracks how many interrupts have taken place.

### Problems + Advice
I had some trouble figuring out the interrupt pins and the attachInterrupt. I didn't understand how the pins worked with the photointerrupter, but I did research on google and asked for help. Looking at other students work and code comments on the CHS Sigma Wiki was also extremely helpful in understanding what I needed to do. ‚ù§
